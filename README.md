This is a thrust vector controlled rocket that should be capable of launch and landing, under motor power. Rather than depending on passive stability, this rocket gimbals the solid rocket motor (An Estes D12 black powder motor) to change the thrust direction, creating a torque that will change the direction of the rocket to keep it pointing straight up. The rocket will fire it's first motor to launch, and then, based on measurements of altitude, fire the second motor to slow it down for landing. This rocket is composed of three major subsystems: the gimbal, flight computer, and landing legs. The gimbal positions the motor, based on the commands of the flight computer, which are in turn, based on the sensors on the flight computer. The flight computer will also control flight events such as the ingnition of the launch motor. The landing legs serve to hold the rocket upright after landing, and abosrb the shock of landing.
